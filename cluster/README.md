# Feast on Azure Kubernetes Service

The Feast on AKS is a secure enterprise deployment on a customer provisioned AKS cluster in an Azure VNET. This deployment does not expose any public endpoints and leverages Azure Private Link over the Feast core and serving so that the traffic flows over the Microsoft Network. This deployment also supports secure connectivity from Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Machine Learning integration via private endpoints.
