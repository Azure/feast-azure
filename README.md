# Feast on Azure

This project provides resources to enable running a [feast](http://feast.dev) feature store on Azure.

## Feast Azure Provider
The [Feast Azure provider](./provider/README.md) acts like a plugin that allows Feast users to connect to:

- Azure SQL DB and/or Synapse SQL as the _offline store_
- Azure cache for Redis as the _online store_
- Azure blob storage for the feast _registry store_

### üìê Architecture

The _interoperable_ design of feast means that many Azure services can be used to _produce_ and/or _consume_ features (for example: Azure ML, Synapse, Azure Databricks, Azure functions, etc).

### üê±‚Äçüë§ Getting Started

If you want to install locally:

```bash
pip install feast-azure-provider
```

We recommend the [getting started tutorial](provider/tutorial/) that walks you through an end-to-end example.

You can deploy the infrastructure for feast using:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Ffeast-azure%2Fmain%2Fprovider%2Ftutorial%2Fsetup%2Fazuredeploy.json)

The only 2 required parameters during the set-up are:

- **Admin Password** for the the SQL Server being deployed.
- **Principal ID** this is to set the storage permissions for the feast registry store. You can find the value for this by opening **Cloud Shell** and run the following command:

```bash
az ad signed-in-user show --query objectId -o tsv
```
